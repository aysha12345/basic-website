I decided to try and make my website as easy to read as possible. 
I picked colours that didn't make me strain my eyes and chose a font and
font size that I think is easy to read. I put a vertical navigation bar at the top
of the page because most websites I use have that kind of navigation bar
and I think it's easy to use even if you are inexperienced with computers. 
I tried to be as consistent as possible
with my design, I did this by trying to keep the layout on my pages as consistent
as possible by using the same colours, keeping the layout of my pictures and captions
the same, keeping the font and font size the same and so on. I tried to make my
banner at the top of the page as eye catching as possible by making the text really big
and giving it a unique border. I think my banner is a bit plain
and if I had more time I would like to have maybe made a different one for each page,
for example, for the history page I could have put a picture related to the page as the background
of the banner.

One major challenge I had was adding the bootstrap. I misunderstood the instructions and designed all of my website in
css. This ended up causing problems when I reached sections D and F which required bootstrap.
My bootstrap and css clashed with each other and it took quite a bit of time to find everything in my 
css file that needed to be changed to fix the layout of the website, I'm also
very inexperienced with bootstrap which didn't help. If I could redo my website from the start
I would have included bootstrap from the very beginning to prevent this. I also had trouble
figuring out where to find photos I was allowed to use but then I remembered about Wikimedia Commons.

Overall, I think my website isn't very good and could do with a lot of changes
and improvements but it was the best that I could do.
