                <p>
                    In 1881, one of two polar bears that had been brought to Dundee by a whaling ship
                    escaped and ran around Commercial Street. The polar bear chased after a man
                    and ended up entering a shop with him. When the polar bear got inside it became
                    enraged with its own reflection that it saw in a mirror inside the shop. Eventually,
                    some men managed to enter the back of the shop and recapture it while the bear was
                    distracted by the mirror.<sup>3</sup> This year, a statue, that was 
                    commissioned by the Dundee City Council, of the
                    polar bear and the man it chased was put up in Dundee's City
                    Center with a plaque describing the incident.<sup>4</sup>

                    The Tay Whale, also referred to as 'The Monster', was a humpback whale
                    that was hunted hunted in the River Tay in 1883. The whale was first seen
                    in the Firth of Tay. After multiple attempts to harpoon it, one ship
                    finally managed to harpoon it in the neck. Multiple boats joined the
                    boat that harpooned the whale in an attempt to slow it down but the whale
                    kept moving and eventually, after passing the Broughty Castle it began to turn
                    dark outside and the whale disappeared out to sea along with the boats that
                    were connected to it with the harpoon line. The whale ended up going in a circle
                    and swam back in the direction of Dundee. Once the boat and ship were spotted in
                    Dundee again people continued to fire weapons at the whale to try and speed up its
                    death but the harpoon ended up coming out of the whale and it swam away. The body of
                    the whale was found in the sea near Stonehaven a week later. Today the skeleton of
                    the Tay Whale can be seen in the McManus museum.<sup>5</sup>

                    In 1879, the Tay Bridge (the bridge that connects Dundee with Fife) collapsed into
                    the River Tay during a storm,
                    resulting in the deaths of the 75 people who were riding the train that was
                    on the bridge at the time. The Court of Inquiry 
                    investigating the collapse of the bridge concluded
                    that the disaster was caused by the lack of cross bracings on the bridge,
                    and that if proper safety measures had been put in place while building the bridge
                    it wouldn't have collapsed from the storm.<sup>6</sup> The bridge has now been
                    rebuilt and hopefully won't collapse again. In 2013 a memorial with the 59 names
                    (only 59 out of 75 of the victims names are known) was put up on both the Dundee
                    and Fife side of the Tay Bridge.<sup>7</sup>

                    Dundee is well known
                    for it's three J's: Jute, Jam and Journalism.

                <p>
                    Dundee used to produce so much jute that it was known as 'Juteopolis'. In the
                    1700s it was already well known for producing large quantities of
                    linen. In the 1830s Dundee started producing jute alongside
                    linen. The jute production
                    quickly took over and Dundee was then known more for its
                    jute production than its linen production. By the 1920s,
                    the Dundee jute industry declined as it was overtaken by the jute industry
                    in India, eventually it stopped producing jute altogether.

                    Marmalade was (allegedly) created by a woman from Dundee in the 1700s.
                    Her recipe was then further developed by her son, James Keiller,
                    who proceded to open factories
                    that produced jams and marmalades. The jam his factory produced
                    used to be famous world wide although it is no longer 
                    produced now.<sup>8</sup>

                    Dundee is also home to DC Thomson & Son Ltd which produces various magazines, comics and newspapers
                    such as: Danger Mouse, The Sunday Post, Bunty and Mandy.<sup>9</sup> Some very iconic
                    characters such as Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx and The Bash Street Kids come from
                    DC Thomson publications.

                <p>
                    A volcanic sill<sup>10</sup> with a great view of the whole of Dundee. In the Iron Age
                    it was used as a hillfort that protected both people and their livestock
                    during wars. In the 1800s a tunnel was built through the hill for the
                    Dundee to Newtyle railway. On 1925 a war memorial was built in memory of the
                    men who lost their lives during the First World War. In the 1940s, during the
                    Second World War, a pillbox was built on the hill to be used as a lookout. The tunnel
                    that was built for the railway in the 1800s was used as a shelter during air raids.
                    In the 1960s the woodland was restored to the Law Hill, the Law finally had trees again
                    after hundreds of years.<sup>11</sup>
