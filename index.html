            <h4><u>About Dundee</u></h4>
            <p>
                This city in the east coast is well known for a variety of important cultural
                and historical events. In 2018, the <abbr title = "Victoria and Albert">V&A</abbr> Musuem was 
                opened to the general public. This was a very important moment for Dundee as the V&A is the first 
                design musuem in Scotland and currently the only other V&A Musuem in the whole world, with the 
                first one being in London.<sup>3</sup> But that isn't the only important cultural landmark in Dundee, 
                we also have the RSS Discovery, a ship that resulted in Dundee being known as "The City of Discovery". 
                <sup>4</sup> You can learn more about this ship that has been all the way to the Antartic on our 
                <a href="essential.html" target="_blank">essential experiences</a> page alongside some other 
                essential Dundee experiences.
